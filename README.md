# Reflections
This week, our main task was centered on Rhino, Grasshopper, and incorporating laser cutting to create a phone stand. My journey with Rhino began a few years ago. The exercise gave me an opportunity to brush up on the foundational knowledge that I have not been using recently. Grasshopper is quite different from the direct modeling approach in Rhino. While I am well-acquainted with Rhino, Grasshopper's node-based system is challenging for me. The logic and the connection of components seemed a bit overwhelming and I plan to dig deeper into this in the following weeks. The laser-cutting process was straightforward. The more challenging part is to ensure that the laser is cutting through the wood boards. I'm looking forward to making more exiting projects later on. The following images are of the phone stand and the process of making it.

# Speculations
I think Rhino will continue to integrate more intuitive tools, making it more user-friendly. As for Grasshopper, I wish there would also be a more visual/beginner-friendly interface so that it's easier to navigate. I think there will be more plugins, easier UI, and perhaps AI-driven components to predict and auto-generate designs based on user input.
